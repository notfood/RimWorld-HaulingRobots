	<description>Adds a hauling bot which can be crafted.  "Base Robots" MUST be installed

Base Robots provides a main "Robots" tab where you can see all active robots, rename them, and assign them to an area.

Feel free to make your own custom robots using Base Robots.  I will be writing a tutorial, but until then you can use this mod as an example.  The only things needed are textures and XML defs - the code is already taken care of.
